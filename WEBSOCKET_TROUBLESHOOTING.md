# WebSocket Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ PROBLEM RESOLVED

The WebSocket connection issues have been successfully fixed! Both servers are now running properly:
- ‚úÖ Next.js server: `http://localhost:3000`
- ‚úÖ WebSocket server: `ws://localhost:3001`

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. Port Mismatch ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: WebSocket server was running on port 3000, but client was trying to connect to port 3001
- **Fix**: Updated `scripts/start-ws-server.js` to use port 3001 by default
- **Files Changed**: `scripts/start-ws-server.js`

### 2. Missing Error Handling ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: WebSocket server lacked proper error handling and connection management
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling, ping/pong keep-alive, and connection monitoring
- **Files Changed**: `server/wsServer.ts`

### 3. Client-Side Connection Issues ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Client lacked proper error handling and timeout configuration
- **Fix**: Added error handling, timeout configuration, and better connection management
- **Files Changed**: `config/Provider.tsx`

### 4. Separate WebSocket Test Conflicts ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Creating separate WebSocket connections for testing was causing conflicts with tRPC WebSocket
- **Fix**: Removed separate WebSocket test and implemented centralized WebSocket status tracking
- **Files Changed**: `components/layout/messages/MessageUI.tsx`, `config/Provider.tsx`

### 5. React State Update Errors ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: WebSocket event handlers were trying to update React state before component mounting
- **Fix**: Added mounted state tracking and conditional state updates
- **Files Changed**: `config/Provider.tsx`

### 6. TypeScript Compilation Errors ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: TypeScript errors in WebSocket server and auth configuration
- **Fix**: Fixed type definitions and proper typing for all components
- **Files Changed**: `server/wsServer.ts`, `auth/index.ts`

### 7. Missing Environment Configuration ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: WebSocket URL not properly configured
- **Fix**: Added proper environment variable setup and fallback configuration

## Final Solution

The main issues were:

1. **WebSocket Conflicts**: The `MessageUI` component was creating its own WebSocket connection for testing, which conflicted with the tRPC WebSocket connection
2. **React State Updates**: WebSocket event handlers were updating state before component mounting
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Missing type definitions and improper typing

### What Was Fixed:

1. **Removed Separate WebSocket Test**: Eliminated the separate WebSocket connection test in `MessageUI` that was causing conflicts
2. **Centralized WebSocket Status**: Created a WebSocket context in `Provider.tsx` to track the actual tRPC WebSocket connection status
3. **Better Error Handling**: Added proper error handling throughout the WebSocket connection lifecycle
4. **Improved Connection Management**: Added ping/pong keep-alive and connection monitoring
5. **Fixed React State Updates**: Added mounted state tracking to prevent state updates before component mounting
6. **Resolved TypeScript Errors**: Fixed all type definitions and compilation issues

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Servers Running Successfully
- **Next.js Development Server**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **WebSocket Server**: `ws://localhost:3001`
- **Both servers**: Running concurrently with `pnpm run dev:all`

### ‚úÖ WebSocket Connection Working
- **Connection Status**: Stable and maintained
- **Real-time Messaging**: Functional
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive
- **Auto-reconnection**: Implemented

## How to Run the Application

### Option 1: Run Both Servers Together (Recommended)
```bash
pnpm run dev:all
```

### Option 2: Run Servers Separately
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Next.js development server
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2: Start WebSocket server
pnpm dev:ws
```

## Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
# WebSocket Server Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001
WS_PORT=3001

# Other required environment variables...
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Debugging WebSocket Connection

### 1. Check Server Status
Look for these console messages:
- ‚úÖ `WebSocket Server listening on ws://localhost:3001`
- ‚úÖ `‚ûï Connection established from: [IP]`

### 2. Check Client Status
Look for these console messages:
- ‚úÖ `üîå WebSocket connection opened`
- ‚ùå `‚ùå WebSocket connection error: [error details]`

### 3. Visual Indicators
The messaging interface now shows:
- üü¢ Green dot: Connected
- üü° Yellow dot: Connecting
- üî¥ Red dot: Disconnected (with error details)

## Testing the Fix

1. Start both servers: `pnpm run dev:all`
2. Open the messaging interface
3. Check the WebSocket status indicator (should show green dot)
4. Monitor browser console for connection logs
5. Test sending/receiving messages in real-time

## Technical Improvements Made

### Server-Side (`server/wsServer.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Implemented ping/pong keep-alive mechanism
- ‚úÖ Added connection monitoring and cleanup
- ‚úÖ Improved logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Added graceful shutdown handling
- ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript type definitions

### Client-Side (`config/Provider.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Added WebSocket error handling
- ‚úÖ Implemented connection timeout (10 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Added retry logic for failed connections
- ‚úÖ Improved logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Created centralized WebSocket status context
- ‚úÖ Fixed React state update issues

### UI Improvements (`components/layout/messages/MessageUI.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Removed conflicting WebSocket test connection
- ‚úÖ Uses centralized WebSocket status from context
- ‚úÖ Added visual WebSocket status indicator
- ‚úÖ Added detailed error reporting

### Auth Configuration (`auth/index.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript type errors
- ‚úÖ Proper session callback typing
- ‚úÖ Removed unused parameters

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Eliminated WebSocket Conflicts
- Removed separate WebSocket connection test in `MessageUI`
- Now uses the actual tRPC WebSocket connection status

### 2. Centralized Status Management
- Created `WebSocketContext` in `Provider.tsx`
- Provides real-time WebSocket status across the application
- Eliminates duplicate connection attempts

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Added proper try-catch blocks
- Implemented timeout handling
- Added connection state management
- Fixed React state update timing issues

### 4. TypeScript Compliance
- Fixed all type definition errors
- Proper WebSocket type usage
- Correct session callback typing

## Performance Optimizations

- Disabled WebSocket compression for better performance
- Added connection pooling and cleanup
- Implemented efficient ping/pong mechanism
- Added timeout handling to prevent hanging connections
- Eliminated duplicate WebSocket connections

## Security Considerations

- All WebSocket connections require authentication
- Messages are filtered by user permissions
- Connection cleanup prevents resource leaks
- Error handling prevents information disclosure

## ‚úÖ Final Status: RESOLVED

All WebSocket connection issues have been successfully resolved. The application now provides:
- Stable WebSocket connections
- Real-time messaging functionality
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Visual status indicators
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
